#Thoughts
thoughts is a desktop application coded in Python and using the Pygame library. It's a simple game that displays your 
gross words per minute as you type out random thoughts.

#Setting Up
Clone the repo onto your device. If you have Python installed already, you can run the application from your terminal 
by typing:
```
python thoughts.py
```

If you don't have Python installed on your device already, you can download and install it from their website 
[here](https://www.python.org/).

#Behind the Project
This project was created at my time at Code Chrysalis as a student. It was a project for polyglottal week. What does 
this mean? In short, it's to engage students in their abilities to adapt and learn new/updating technologies quickly. 
I chose to learn Python as I had never used it before, and this project was made within the 5 day period that we were 
given.
